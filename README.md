Dead employees will only come back to life once the quota is met. If your entire crew dies, you'll get fired.

Not only does this make the game significantly more difficult, it also allows you to store and sell your crewmates' bodies as if they were scrap.

Also, since The Company no longer revives dead bodies during a run, no death penalties will be applied.

## IMPORTANT
**All players** need to have this mod installed for it to work properly, otherwise major desync issues will occur.
